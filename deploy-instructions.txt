# Deployment Instructions for Khadraoui Website

## Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository**:
    - Go to GitHub and create a new repository named `khadraoui-website`.
    - Push your code:
      ```bash
      git init
      git add .
      git commit -m "Initial commit"
      git branch -M main
      git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/khadraoui-website.git
      git push -u origin main
      ```

2.  **Connect to Vercel**:
    - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login.
    - Click "Add New..." -> "Project".
    - Import your `khadraoui-website` repository.
    - Framework Preset: Vite
    - Build Command: `npm run build`
    - Output Directory: `dist`
    - Click "Deploy".

3.  **Environment Variables**:
    - No environment variables are strictly required for the static build, but if you add a CMS later, add them in Vercel Project Settings > Environment Variables.

## Option 2: Netlify

1.  Drag and drop the `dist` folder (generated after `npm run build`) into the Netlify Drop zone.
2.  Or connect your GitHub repository similar to Vercel.

## Post-Deploy Checks

1.  **Verify Domain**: Ensure `khadraoui.dz` (or your domain) is connected.
2.  **Test Forms**: Check if the contact form works (currently alerts, needs backend integration).
3.  **Check SEO**: Run Google Lighthouse on the live URL.
